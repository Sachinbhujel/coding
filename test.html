                <p>Marriage License is an oil painting by American illustrator Norman Rockwell (pictured) created for the cover of the June 11, 1955, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. It depicts a young man and woman filling out a marriage license application at a government building in front of a bored-looking clerk. Although the room and its furnishings are dark, the couple are illuminated by the window beside them. The contrast between the couple and the clerk highlights two reoccurring themes in Rockwell's works: young love and ordinary life. The painting has been praised by critics and compared to the works of Johannes Vermeer due to the use of light and dark. The painting is in the Norman Rockwell Museum's collection and has been a part of major exhibitions in 1955, 1972, and 1999. In 2004 the magazine Mad published a parody of Marriage License that depicted a pair of gay men, seen as a commentary on competing meanings of marriage and the government's role in deciding whether same-sex marriage is valid.
