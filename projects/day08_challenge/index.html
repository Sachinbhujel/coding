      <p>Lakes can be used for the production or development of hydel power. They moderate the climate surroundings by maintaining the aquatic ecosystem, enhancing the natural beauty, and also helping in developing tourism and providing recreation. Saltwater lake is also used for the production of salt.</p>

      <p>Over 1.6 billion people depend on forests for food or fuel, and some 70 million people worldwide - including many Indigenous communities - call forests home. Forests provide us with oxygen, shelter, jobs, water, nourishment and fuel. With so many people dependent on forests, the fate of our forests may determine our own fate as well.</p>

      <p>The dry condition of deserts helps promote the formation and concentration of important minerals. Gypsum, borates, nitrates, potassium and other salts build up in deserts when water carrying these minerals evaporates. Minimal vegetation has also made it easier to extract important minerals from desert regions.</p>
